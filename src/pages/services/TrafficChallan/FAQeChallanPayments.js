            Following traffic rules is each and everyone’s duty to ensure not only one’s safety but of other people as well. However, one may need to pay for a traffic challan issued to them for violating traffic rules of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988, or for not following them at all. Some of the violations typically include not wearing a helmet, driving without a valid license, over speeding the vehicle, not following signal lights, etc.

            The introduction of eChallan online payment is an initiative taken by the Government of India to ensure the transparency of records and enhance its traffic services. Nowadays, almost every procedure is being digitized, so traffic rules violators can also use the online service to pay for the penalties.
          </p>
          <p>
            The government’s main aim to introduce eChallan payment is to negate the bribing process by eliminating cash transactions and making every record maintained online.

            The traffic police have the swiping machine that enables them to create a printed eChallan in no time. So, in a situation where they spot a traffic violator, they can make a real-time entry and print the challan against the traffic rule violator’s name.
          </p>
          <p>
            Using these machines makes it easy for the traffic police to collect the fine on the spot. Once the payment is received, the police issue the traffic violator a formal receipt stating the fine payment has been received successfully.
