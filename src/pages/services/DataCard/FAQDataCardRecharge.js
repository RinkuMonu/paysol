            <strong>What is difference between data card and dongle?</strong>
            <br />A data card is a removable electronic card which allows data
            storage or is used to carry out data operations. A dongle, on the
            other hand, is used for enabling services like software protection,
            audio-video, etc. A dongle used for connection to mobile broadband
            is also referred to as a data card

          <li>
            <strong>Is dongle faster than mobile Internet?</strong>
            <br />
            Both dongle and mobile internet are offered by a wide range of
            operators and the quality of service varies. While a dongle is used
            for internet access in laptop/ computer devices, mobile internet is
            needed for continuous internet access throughout the day. Hence, a
            user must opt for either based on his/her need or requirement.
